            <p> The Heber J. Grant Building is a beautiful structure that serves both students and members of the Church.There are two primary purposes for using the Heber J. Grant Building. The first purpose is for professors and students to gather for their classes. For example, professors who teach in the HGB have access to many classrooms where students can meet, share their knowledge, and help each other understand the lectures.</p>
            <p>The second purpose is for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Church members often gather in the HGB to worship the Lord every Sunday. They use the building for two hours during each session to hold meetings. Additionally, the Bishop uses the building to conduct interviews with church members for church-related purposes.In conclusion, the HGB is a remarkable building that serves as both a place for classes and church meetings. It is a sacred space for BYU-Hawaii students and a center for religious activities</p>
