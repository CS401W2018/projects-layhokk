         <h2>My interest - The Pop Music</h2>
         <p> <span class="Newfont"> Music is my favorite thing to listen to because it helps me release stress from working and studying. Music has many benefits for everyone who enjoys singing and loves to lift their spirits. For me, singing is a part of life, a way to enjoy music. Sometimes, I like to sing with my friends because music brings me closer to others and helps me make new friends. Music lifts my spirit because some songs have encouraging messages that boost my confidence to tackle any task. Music is something I enjoy, both for singing and making new friends.</span> </p>
         <p>I really enjoy listening to music because there are so many different types of songs that I love. For example, I like hip-hop, romantic, and sad songs, among others. With so many options to choose from, music is my go-to when I want to feel relaxed and at peace. Ultimately, music brings me happiness, joy, love, and motivation. I'm a huge fan of listening to a variety of songs, but romantic songs are my favorite.</p>
